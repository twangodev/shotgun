    // Implementation approaches:
    // 1. When to checkpoint:
    //    - After every high-risk action (clicks, submits)
    //    - After batches of 5-10 low-risk actions
    //    - After medium-risk validation-prone fields
    //    - Before navigation attempts
    //    - When errors are suspected
    
    // 2. Optimization strategies:
    //    - Skip if no actions executed
    //    - Use lighter snapshot if possible
    //    - Consider targeted snapshots (section only)
    //    - Reuse if page hasn't changed
    
    // 3. Storage approach:
    //    - Store with timestamp
    //    - Keep last N checkpoints
    //    - Link to action batch that triggered it
    //    - Compress if large
    
    // 4. Alternative to full snapshot:
    //    - playwright_evaluate() for specific checks
    //    - "Are there error messages visible?"
    //    - "What's the current field count?"
    //    - "Has URL changed?"
    //    
    //    But full snapshot better for comprehensive diff
    
    // 5. Cost consideration:
    //    - Each checkpoint costs 10-20K tokens
    //    - Balance frequency vs error detection
    //    - More checkpoints = better debugging
    //    - Fewer checkpoints = better performance
